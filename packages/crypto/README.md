## NEAR Python SDK - Crypto Module

### Overview

The `crypto` module of the NEAR Python SDK provides a comprehensive suite of tools and classes for cryptographic operations, particularly focusing on the handling and manipulation of cryptographic key pairs. This module is essential for creating and verifying digital signatures, a critical component of secure blockchain transactions.

### Modules and Classes

The `crypto` module includes several key components designed to work with NEAR's cryptographic requirements:

- **PublicKey**: A class that represents a public key capable of verifying signatures. This class is essential for validating transactions and data integrity within the NEAR ecosystem.

- **KeyPairBase**: An abstract base class that defines the standard structure and functionality for a cryptographic key pair. This class provides the foundational methods that all specific key pair implementations must adhere to.

- **KeyPair**: An abstract extension of `KeyPairBase`, this class includes static methods for parsing and generating key pairs. It serves as the template from which specific key pair types are derived.

- **KeyPairEd25519**: A concrete implementation of `KeyPairBase`, using the Ed25519 signing algorithm. This class is tailored for high-performance cryptographic operations and is the recommended choice for handling NEAR protocol's key management tasks.

- **Constants**: This module contains keypair-specific constants that are used throughout the cryptographic operations. These constants ensure that key pair operations maintain consistency and adhere to predefined standards.
